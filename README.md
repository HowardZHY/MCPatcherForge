Original source code is under MIT, my changes are lgpl 3.0

End goal is to support any resource pack for 1.7.10 that used Optifines version of MCPatcher features

If you find issues feel free to report, but it might take a while before I get around to it.

Known issue:
- Items with golden in its name like golden_horse_armor or golden_hoe didn't show with default name, you have to use items=minecraft:golden_hoe in the item's properties.
